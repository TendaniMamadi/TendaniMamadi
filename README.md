### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tendani Mamadi, a web development enthusiast. I'm currently diving deep into the world of JavaScript, Node.js, and front-end technologies like Alpine.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'm passionate about building responsive and user-friendly web applications.

ðŸš€ I'm on a journey to enhance my coding skills and create exciting projects. Currently, I'm exploring the power of databases with PostgreSQL and experimenting with responsive design using SimpleGrid.

ðŸ’¼ In my free time, you can find me working on personal web projects or sharing my insights on web development through my social media pages.

Let's connect and learn together! ðŸŒŸ
